## 🎨 IMPORTANT: Create White Logo for Footer

### Why You Need a White Logo:
Your current logo has a red "ai" which blends into the red footer background. This is an accessibility issue (poor contrast).

### How to Create White Logo:

#### Option 1: Canva (Easiest)
1. Open your original logo in Canva
2. Select the entire logo
3. Change ALL colors to white (#FFFFFF)
4. Download as PNG (transparent background)
5. Name it: `sheisai-logo-white.png`
6. Save to: `assets/images/logo/`

#### Option 2: Photoshop/GIMP
1. Open your logo
2. Select all text/elements
3. Change color to white (#FFFFFF)
4. Export as PNG with transparency
5. Name it: `sheisai-logo-white.png`

#### Option 3: If Logo is Simple Text
- Make "SHE IS" in white
- Make "ai" in white (not red!)
- Keep the "!" white if it exists
- Everything should be pure white for contrast

### What the White Logo Should Look Like:
```
Navigation (top):  SHE IS ai (black text, red "ai")
Footer (bottom):   SHE IS ai (ALL WHITE for contrast on red background)
```
